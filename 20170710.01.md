## Ritual

* Dama bowling is both a game and a base skill analyzer
* In Kendama Bowling, the 10 "Pins" are 10 tricks in a ladder. Just as you would roll a ball to knock down as many pins as you can in bowling, in kendama bowling, you start at the beginning of the ladder and complete each trick in succession until you complete all 10 tricks or fail.
* A game is made up of 10 frames. Each frame consists of a trick ladder. Each frame represents one turn for the player, and in each turn the player is allowed two tries to complete the ladder. If the player completes the ladder with the first try (not missing any tricks), it is a strike; if not, a second try at the remaining tricks is attempted. Each consecutive try starts with the last failed trick. If all the tricks are completed in the ladder after two tries, it is a spare; if any pins are left standing, it is an "open frame."

## Gemu
* In an open frame, a bowler simply gets credit for the number of tricks completed. In the case of a spare, a slash mark is recorded in a small square in the upper right-hand corner of that frame on the score sheet, and no score is entered until the first ball of the next frame is rolled.
* Then credit is given for 10 plus the number of tricks completed with the next try. For example, a player rolls a spare in the first frame; with the first try of the second frame, the player gets seven tricks. The first frame, then, gets 17 points. If two of the remaining three tricks are completed, 9 pins are added, for a total of 26 in the second frame.
* If a player gets a strike, it is recorded with an X in the small square, the score being 10 plus the total number of tricks completed in the next two tries. Thus, the player who gets three strikes in a row in the first three frames gets credit for 30 points in the first frame.
* Kendama Bowling's perfect score, a 300 game, represents 12 strikes in a row--a total of 120 tricks landed, in a row, first try. Why 12 strikes, instead of 10? Because, if a bowler gets a strike in the last frame, the score for that frame can't be recorded before rolling twice more. Similarly, if a bowler rolls a spare in the last frame, one more roll is required before the final score can be tallied.



## Tradition
* If a player "gets lost" in the ladder, or accidentally performs the wrong trick, a continuation of play may be granted at the discretion of the other players.
* Once a trick has been failed in a ladder on the first or second try, the player must place the tama in the ending place from the last trick successfully completed and then continue.
* Some trick ladders require a "reset" this simply means after the completion of a trick, remove the tama from the ken and the next trick will begin in the starting posistion.
* For the 10th frame, each play can pick one of the three previous ladders to complete the game.
