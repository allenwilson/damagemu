# Rai Rai Ken

ライライケン

## Ritual

* great for long distance and asychronous play
* it is a ladder building game
* first player sends a video of the first move: ex. big cup, airplane, spike
* next player sends a video of that trick plus an additional trick added to it - this trick must be added without resetting - for example, if the first trick is big cup, then the next player must land big cup and then add a trick from big cup position
* next player repeats



##Gemu
* game ends when the strig becomes so difficult that the next player cannot add a trick within the agreed upon time limit 
* victory goes to the player who made the last addition 


## Tradition

* if there are more than two players, it is typically custom to not have the same players responding without first allowing time for other players to make a contribution. this is of course permitted when itmis necessary for continuing the game (ie nobody else is addi tricks). 
* the time limit is customarily 5-7 days between te latest updated trick and the end of the game. this 1) allows more room for asynchronous play. 2) allows for the development of longer and more complicated ladders. 3) allows players sufficient time to practice weird, idiosyncratic, or otherwise unorthodox tricks that they are not familiar with (thus making rai rai ken a great skill building game).
